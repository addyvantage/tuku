1. Concise diagnosis
- `INTERRUPTED_RUN_RECOVERABLE` still claimed `ReadyForNextRun=true`, which conflicted with the new fresh-run gate that only permits `READY_NEXT_RUN`.
- `DECISION_CONTINUE` still wrote operator-facing `NextAction` text that told the operator to start a run immediately, even though `CONTINUE_EXECUTED` was now required.
- That left recovery projection, run-start behavior, and operator-facing messaging semantically inconsistent.

2. Exact implementation plan executed
- Removed fresh-start readiness from all interrupted-recovery projections.
- Kept interrupted recovery as a distinct posture with `RESUME_INTERRUPTED_RUN`, but made it explicitly non-fresh-startable.
- Updated interrupted canonical responses in both no-mutation and safe-continue paths to say “resume the interrupted execution path” rather than imply a fresh bounded run start.
- Updated `KindDecisionContinue` phase-update messaging so it explicitly requires continue execution before run start.
- Added focused regressions for interrupted recovery alignment and decision-continue operator messaging.

3. Files changed
- `/Users/kagaya/Desktop/Tuku/internal/orchestrator/recovery.go`
- `/Users/kagaya/Desktop/Tuku/internal/orchestrator/recovery_action.go`
- `/Users/kagaya/Desktop/Tuku/internal/orchestrator/service.go`
- `/Users/kagaya/Desktop/Tuku/internal/orchestrator/service_test.go`
- `/Users/kagaya/Desktop/Tuku/internal/orchestrator/shell_test.go`

4. Behavior before vs after
- Before: interrupted recovery looked fresh-start ready in recovery/status/shell even though run-start gating rejected it.
- After: interrupted recovery is recoverable but not fresh-start ready everywhere.
- Before: decision-continue left `NextAction` saying “Start a run...” even though run start was still illegal.
- After: decision-continue now explicitly tells the operator to execute continue recovery first.
- Before: canonical continue text for interrupted recovery could still read like a fresh-run path.
- After: canonical text now consistently describes resuming the interrupted execution path.

5. Recovery semantics after cleanup
- `INTERRUPTED_RUN_RECOVERABLE` now means:
  - interrupted state is recoverable
  - recommended action is `RESUME_INTERRUPTED_RUN`
  - `ReadyForNextRun = false`
- `DECISION_CONTINUE` now means:
  - continue branch selected
  - phase may remain `BRIEF_READY`
  - operator-facing next step is still `ExecuteContinueRecovery`
  - direct run start remains blocked until `CONTINUE_EXECUTED`
- `READY_NEXT_RUN` remains the only fresh bounded-run startable posture.

6. Tests added or updated
- Updated interrupted recovery alignment test to assert:
  - class `INTERRUPTED_RUN_RECOVERABLE`
  - action `RESUME_INTERRUPTED_RUN`
  - `ReadyForNextRun == false`
  - status/inspect also do not claim fresh-start readiness
  - canonical text says resume interrupted execution path
- Updated decision-continue recovery test to assert capsule `NextAction` requires continue execution first.
- Updated shell snapshot interrupted recovery regression so shell no longer treats interrupted recovery as fresh-start ready.

7. Commands run
```bash
gofmt -w internal/orchestrator/recovery.go internal/orchestrator/recovery_action.go internal/orchestrator/service.go internal/orchestrator/service_test.go internal/orchestrator/shell_test.go

go test ./internal/orchestrator ./internal/tui/shell ./internal/app -count=1
```

8. Remaining limitations / follow-up risks
- This patch keeps `BRIEF_READY` for the decision-continue intermediate state. That is acceptable because recovery remains authoritative, but phase semantics are now somewhat overloaded.
- Interrupted recovery is now truthful for fresh-run gating, but there is still no separate first-class “resume interrupted run” execution workflow.
- Operator guidance is now aligned, but Tuku still relies on projected recovery posture rather than a dedicated consolidated readiness artifact.
